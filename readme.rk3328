# creating a u-boot on an sd card which is called from the loader on emmc
# tested to be working on a t9 rk3328 tv box using the legacy emmc loader
# this step for me only worked using the x86 binary of loaderimage on an x86 machine
loaderimage --pack --uboot ./u-boot-dtb.bin u-boot-rk3328.img 0x200000
# this is for the case that it is written directly to sd card
# first dump the boot blocks from emmc to the sd card so that we have everything
# around which the boot might need - do not overwrite the partition table on sd
# (the seek/skip part)
dd if=/dev/emmc of=/dev/sdcard bs=512 skip=1 seek=1 count=32767
# then write the new mainline u-boot in the proper format to the right place
dd if=u-boot-rk3328.img of=/dev/sdcard bs=512 seek=16384

# see misc.rk3328-no-sd-boot/rockchip-u-boot/readme.txt for some notes on
# writing the mainline u-boot image to emmc via rkdeveloptool if desired

# below are old notes about writing the trust.img from emmc to sd card, which is
# done automatically in the approach from above to just dump everythinf from emmc to sd card
# first stage boot comes from emmc still and requires the original trust.img from emmc at 24576
# i think it needs to be put there even on an sd card, i.e.
#   dd if=/dev/emmc of=/dev/sdcard bs=1 skip=24576 seek=24576 count=8192
# u-boot itself is new then and should best run from sd card (safer than overwriting the original stuff on emmc)

# full mainline boot block writing (untested)

# to sd card according to doc/README.rockchip
dd if=idbloader.img of=/dev/mmcblkx seek=64
